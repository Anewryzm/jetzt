# jetzt

*jetzt* is a speed-reader extension for [chrome](http://google.com/chrome) inspired by [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/).

### Installation

This is very much beta software so a proper chrome extension package is not currently provided. Instead: clone this repository, then, in chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions , enable developer mode, click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the directory you cloned.

Remember to pull every now and then for bugfixes and new features.

### Usage

Control is currently keyboard-only.

- Initiate jetzt by pressing `alt`-`s` and clicking on the block of text you wish to read. Alternatively, select some text before pressing `alt`-`s`.

- Change size with `+`/`-`.

- Go faster/slower with up/down arrow keys.

- Go back/forward a sentence with left/right arrow keys (hold `alt` to navigate by paragraphs).

- Pause with space.

- Close with escape.

- Switch between light/dark themes with `0`
